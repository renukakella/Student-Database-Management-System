**Student Database Management System (Python)**

## Description
This repository contains two versions of a simple console-based Student Management System in Python:

1. **Basics Implementation**:  
   - Without functions  
   - Uses direct input, loops, and dictionaries  
   - Good for understanding step-by-step flow

2. **Function-Based Implementation**:  
   - Uses reusable functions for adding, deleting, updating, and viewing students  
   - Includes input validation for age and marks  
   - No global `students` dependency for add/delete/update functions  
   - Easier to maintain and extend

## Features
- Add student (ID, Name, Age, Marks)  
- Update student details  
- Delete student by ID  
- View all students  
- Find the topper (highest marks)  
- Input validation:
  - Age > 0  
  - Marks between 0-100
